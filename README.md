# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project 
I created a project that gets input from a file, then the code makes that input into a list
the code makes a two different types of maps to display in the menu that I also made.

# Something New I did
I created maps and iterator for the first time in this project. Also I used for each loops for the second time ever.

# What could I enhance
I could enhance this code with a class that uses maps

# What did I find challenging about this project
I found the whole use of maps a little difficult until I understood how to actually use them with the iterators

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferrable to other projects
I think maps, for each loops, lists, and pairs will definetly help me with futurte projects
All of these things seems like a much easier and better way to write code
